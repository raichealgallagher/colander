<h2>Simplifying Cisco Support </h2>
<p>
Our goal here at Colander Technology is to be different. We understand that some people have teams that are technical enough to know when they have a problem and when they need help from the Vendor directly. </p>
<p>Your IT infrastructure is the lifeline that connects your business to customers and suppliers. Cisco Smart Net Total Care&trade; helps reduce downtime with fast, expert technical support and flexible hardware coverage provided by the Cisco Technical Assistance Center (TAC). It also offers integrated smart capabilities, providing current information about your installed base, contracts, and security alerts to enhance the efficiency of your support workflows. </p>
<p>The TAC is staffed by Cisco experts and is accessible 24 hours a day, 365 days a year. Technical services available through the TAC are backed by advance hardware replacement with fast response times, including 2-hour, 4-hour, and next-business-day options. Online self-help tools include our extensive knowledge library, software downloads, and support tools designed to help you resolve network issues quickly without opening a case.</p>
<h2>Multi Lingual, global Cisco support on your terms </h2>
<p>At Colander Technology, we only sell fully Cisco approved Smart Net Total Care support and give you direct access to Cisco TAC directly to reduce overall support costs. </p>

<p>With over 20 years' experience of Cisco Support, please contact us today to provide a review of your existing Cisco support contracts, type of Cisco support contracts along with a complementary Cisco approved report. </p>

<h2>Experienced, Flexible, Approachable </h2>

<p>Operating environments for organisations is increasingly getting complex. While IT is no longer a support function in an organisation, transformation of functional areas needs to be in harmony with the business strategy too. As change becomes the new normal in the business world, organisations today continually need to reinvent themselves to retain staff and remain competitive.  </p>

<p>Colander Technology helps you achieve and sustain this success through strategic, functional and process transformation that enables you improve performance, increase effectiveness and reduce costs. We have delivered business advisory, functional transformation, IT consulting, risk and compliance services to many of the world's leading organisations.</p>

<p>In the role of a trusted advisor, Colander Technology consistently delivers solutions that are implementable and measurable and always customised to your requirements. </p>

<h2>Leading Transformation Experts </h2>
<p>IT is no longer a support function in an organisation and is seen as a key business driver. Data analytics, HR tools, CRM and even personal devices have become the backbone to enable an organisation function efficiently. Such trends are impacting the very fabric of business in more ways than we can estimate.</p>
<p>Continual improvement of the technology landscape within an organisation through system consolidation and process engineering, adoption of technology process and hardware as a service, outsourcing of technology to more cost effective locations, enablement of higher IT security measures in a cloud environment are trends which are impacting the decisions of companies across the world.</p>
<p>Organisations are continuously trying to transform their business models to address changing customer needs, consolidate market positions and to expand into new segments and geographies. Moreover, globalisation, digitisation, shift in economic growth regions, changes in energy costs and adoption of newer technologies across industries are changing the dynamics of business faster than ever before. These changes in marketplace dynamics call for changes in business strategy and models.</p>
<p>Colander Technology can help you come up with an operating model that delivers the desired business outcome at all scales. Our operating models are simple, flexible and resilient, helping you grasp business opportunities while also optimising cost and productivity.</p>
